# editdata-github

**Work in progress.** An API client for GitHub that performs common actions needed by EditData projects.

## What does it do?
- Get a CSV file parsed into an array of objects, make changes, then commit the changes to the CSV.
- Fork a repository, make a branch, commit changes, then open a pull request.
- _probably some other things too_

## Status
Just getting started. Don't use it yet. Functionality is being pulled out of existing EditData projects like [editdata.org](http://github.com/editdata/editdata.org) and [submit-data](http://github.com/editdata/submit-data)
